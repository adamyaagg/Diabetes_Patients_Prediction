# Diabetes_Patients_Prediction
This repository contains code and resources for developing a diagnostic prediction model to identify diabetes in patients using specific diagnostic measurements. The project focuses on transforming .csv data into actionable insights, enabling the prediction of whether a patient has diabetes or not.📈

<br>
In this project, I delved into the world of healthcare data analysis🩺. I analyzed data from 768 women, spanning ages 21 to 81, to understand diabetes patterns. The findings are remarkable:
<br>
📌 Out of the 768 women, 268 (that's 35%) have diabetes.
<br>
<br>
Here's a quick look at the **Project Summary and Insights from the Dataset** I discovered:
<br>
<br>
📌 There are primarily three types of diabetes: 
   1) Type 1 diabetes, which is typically diagnosed in childhood 
   2) Type 2 diabetes, which is more common and usually develops in adulthood.
   3) Gestational diabetes, temporary form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy.
• Dataset source: Insights from the *National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases* Dataset (.csv)
<br>
• Objective: To develop a diagnostic prediction model for identifying diabetes in patients using specific diagnostic measurements.
<br>
• Target audience: Female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged at least 21 years old.
<br>
<br>
📊 Insights from the dataset are:
<br>
<br>
• Being overweight or obese and being over the age of 30 are significant risk factors for diabetes. Maintaining a healthy weight and regular checkups can reduce the risk.
<br>
• The number of pregnancies a woman experiences correlates with the likelihood of diabetes. Regular blood sugar monitoring is crucial, especially with increasing pregnancies.
<br>
• Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF) assesses diabetes risk based on age and family history. Higher DPF values indicate a greater likelihood of diabetes development.
<br>
• There's a strong relationship between glucose levels and diabetes. Levels above 140 indicate, the person is considered to have impaired glucose tolerance, Glucose is a major diabetes risk factor. Factors influencing high glucose include stress, diet, and certain medications.
<br>
• Increased skin thickness often indicates insulin resistance. Excess insulin in the body leads to fat storage, causing thickening.
<br>
<br>
💡 Testing Data Result: The model is **75% accurate** in predicting whether the patient has diabetes or not.
